simple Bubble Sort visualizer generates a random array of five numbers and visually demonstrates how the Bubble Sort algorithm compares and swaps elements step by step. Each stage of the sorting process is displayed so the progression from unsorted to sorted order is easy to understand.




**🛠 Toolkits Used**

HTML 
CSS
JavaScript

**⚙️ The Process**

Created helper functions to generate random numbers and arrays.
Built reusable functions to dynamically create containers and populate them with span elements.
Implemented comparison logic to determine element order.
Implemented element swapping for Bubble Sort.
Built visual highlighting to show which elements are currently being compared.
Connected UI buttons to generate arrays and run the sorting visualization.
Displayed every step of the sorting process as a new row.

**📚 What I Learned**

comparisons and swaps.
Managing application state between user interactions.
How visual feedback improves algorithm understanding.
The importance of variable scope in JavaScript.
Structuring reusable functions for cleaner code.

**🚀 Features**

Generates random arrays of numbers.
Step-by-step Bubble Sort visualization.
Highlights currently compared elements.
Displays every sorting step including the initial and final array.
Stops early if no swaps are needed (optimized Bubble Sort behavior).
Fully dynamic DOM rendering.

**🔧 How It Can Be Improved**

Add animation delays between steps for smoother visualization.
Allow custom array size input.
Provide speed control slider.
Add other sorting algorithms, Selection, Insertion, etc.
Show pass counters or comparison counts.
Improve UI styling and layout.
Add reset / replay controls.
Make it responsive for mobile screens.
